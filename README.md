#DATA WRANGLING: PROJECT DESCRIPTION

##Choose Your Map Area

Choose any area of the world from https://www.openstreetmap.org, and download a XML OSM dataset. The dataset should be at least 50MB in size (uncompressed). 

##Process your Dataset

##SQL
Thoroughly audit and clean your dataset, converting it from XML to CSV format. Then import the cleaned .csv files into a SQL database using this schema or a custom schema of your choice.

##Explore your Database
After building your local database youâ€™ll explore your data by running queries.
